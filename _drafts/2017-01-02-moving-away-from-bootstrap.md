By now every developer knows about [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/), they've probably used it multiple times throughout their carreers, others have started with it and are still using it.

## What is Bootstrap?

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.

In short, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) provides you with a set of generic functionality that you can re-use throughout your application, this includes grids, styling for buttons but also JavaScript functionality such as modal windows, alerts and tooltips.

It's the perfect framework because it has all the things modern day websites need, and it makes everything re-useable, so what's not to love?

## Bootstrap developers wanted

I always let out a little chuckle when I see "Bootstrap" as a required skill in a job description, I think to myself "sure, I know how to apply CSS classes and use JavaScrip".

Even during technical job interviews people have asked me "Do you know Bootstrap", I'm not sure if they expect me to answer with anything more than a "Yes" or they actually expect me to talk about Bootstrap.
There's really not much to "know" about Bootstrap, you look at the documentation, copy the correct HTML/CSS and paste it somewhere else. If you're lucky you get to use a jQuery plugin.

During some recruitment rounds for a frontend developer, we gave out a simple coding test to test the canidates frontend experience, I found it emberassing to recieve several applications to consiteted out of just a Bootstrapped HTML pages.
This was the opportunity to show us your frontend skills, why not actually show them instead of copy/pasting?
